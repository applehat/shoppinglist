# Shopping List
A simple shopping list in React

## Requirements
This app makes the assumption that you have an instance of [DataPond](https://github.com/applehat/datapond) running on the same machine.

The default dataset in DataPond is catered to this app, tho it should work fine with an empty dataset as well.

## Why
Mainly an excuse to continue learning React, as well as something to consume [DataPond](https://github.com/applehat/datapond)

## Running

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
